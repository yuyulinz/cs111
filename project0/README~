Lab 0: Warm-Up

lab0.c - Source file. Takes standard input and outputs to standard output.

Makefile - makefile for building, quick testing, cleaning, and compressing (using dist)

	 - make check first creates a file "test" and writes "hello" into it. lab0 is then
	   run changing the input to "test". The output is changed to "test2". The program
	   will create this file and write the contents of "test" into it. Diff is then used
	   to compare. If there is no difference, then smoke-test passed, else failed.

backtrace - backtrace is a screenshot of gdb running lab0 --segfault and then backtrace
	    that is taken after the segfault

breakpoint - breakpoint is a screenshot of gdb running lab0 --segfault where a breakpoint
	     is placed right before a null pointer is accessed and stored. Before this step
	     we examined the content of the null pointer and it is indeed 0x0 which is the
	     null pointer.
